       <strong>Eden Wedding DJ Service </strong>
       was set up by Lee Eden

{{ site.title }} brings over 20 years experience as a professional DJ & producer.

I was inspired to set up {{ site.title }} after a summer of attending friend’s weddings.  We were surprised to find that the wedding DJ’s we saw were unapproachably grumpy, and didn’t seem to want to be there at all!

I am always reliable, punctual, courteous and dressed to suit the occasion – smart casual, suit or black tie.

I offer a free, no obligation, face-to-face consultation. This allows me to get to know you, your taste in music, and which songs will have you and your guests dancing all night long.

Check out some of our mixes below to give you some idea of the tunes I enjoy…
