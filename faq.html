## FAQ

__HOW LONG DO YOU NEED TO SET UP?__

We use a state of the art digital system so we can be set up in as little as 30 minutes. It looks good, sounds great and we have backup equipment & vehicle, just in case.  We spend significantly more than our competitors on Wedding DJ and mobile disco equipment to make sure it is of the highest quality both in performance and reliability. All Wedding DJ equipment is maintained and tested in accordance with I.S.O. 9002 (P.A.T. Testing).

__ARE YOU INSURED?__

We hold £1,000,000 Public Liability Insurance, which is required by many venues. Our equipment is regularly Portable Appliance Tested (PAT) to conform with Health & Safety regulations.

__ARE YOU A MEMBER OF A DJ ASSOCIATION?__

We are a member of NADJ (National Association of DJs) An association for professional mobile DJ’s, to attain membership all equipment must pass UK safety standards (PAT testing) and the company must carry Public Liability Insurance. We are happy to provide you with a copy of the documentation on request.

__HOW FAR WILL YOU TRAVEL?__

We will travel anywhere for events, and charge 40p per mile for jobs over 50 miles from Bristol.  Events within 50 miles are included in the package price.

__WHAT MUSIC DO YOU HAVE?__

Our Wedding DJ Playlists consist of over 15,000 tracks covering every music genre from 1920′s to current. We update the Playlists every week to keep abreast of current music releases. This allows us to play most of the requests made on the night by guests. All of our DJs are happy to take requests both in advance and on the night and we will have access to Spotify for any last minute favorites (or guilty pleasures!) you or your guests request. You are also welcome to create your own list of songs. Any tracks not on our list that you wish played will be purchased for your event.  If you have any special CD’s you would like played this can be done with no fuss and all media will be returned at the end of the event.

__WHEN AND HOW SHOULD PAYMENT BE MADE?__

A booking is not deemed to be confirmed until an advanced payment of £100 (or an amount agreed between the booking agent and the Customer) has been paid. Financial settlement is to take place no later than fourteen days before the performance(s).  If additional performance time is required, the additional fee must be agreed with, and paid to the DJ(s) at the time of request. All other methods of payment will be by mutual agreement.
