        What we offer
    </p>
</div>

At most weddings, only 5% of your budget will be spent on entertainment, and yet over 67% of guests will remember your entertainment choice more than anything else about the reception.  Wedding DJs only cost about the same as a chocolate fountain or five minutes of fireworks!

We have tried to keep our pricing simple by offering complete wedding DJ packages for a basic price - all equipment, planning and time is included, so it is only if you, or your venue, require a significant upgrade that we will consider adding on extras.

Have a gander at our full & half day pricing packages and if you have any questions get in touch with us <a class="page-scroll" href="#contact"> here...<a/>

Same as the Evening Wedding DJ package above but 12 hours – usually midday to midnight. The full 12 hours allows us to set up before any guests arrive, play background music when required & allow radio microphones to be available all day for speeches.

Upgrade packages available: we also own, or have access to, a whole bunch of interesting additions that you might also want to ask us about – photo booths, bubble machines, smoke machines, confetti cannons, lights, lasers, mirror balls, projections, UV lights, strobes, karaoke & anything else you can think of that we haven’t!
